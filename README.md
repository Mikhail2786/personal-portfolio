# Personal Portfolio
This is my first project through The Learning People's front end developers course.
## Description
This is my Personal Portfolio where i will display my course/personal/client projects for future clients, employers and anyone who wants to just view my work.

## UX
### Home
My *Home page* will be the first page the users sees so it is important I draw the user in with a logo that sets the visual tone for my websites. The logo I have used is a logo that was created for the purpose of the project with subtle colours to give the user the idea that my portfolio is pleasing on the eye but easy to navigate.

### About Me
My *About me page* is to give the user a brief description of who i am, what i look like and my front end development journey.

### Portfolio
My *Portfolio page* will be where the user comes to view my projects. There will be an image of the websites, a brief description and a link that will take them to each project in a new page.

### Contact Me
My *Contact me page* is designed so any potential clients/collaborators are able to get in touch but provide their name, email, subject matter and a short message. My contact details are also displayed should they wish to choose another method to get in touch. 

### User Story
- As a potential employer, i want to know more about the developers journey and i want to see different projects he has created or contributed to.  

- As a penitential company business looking for a freelancer, i want to know if the developer can bring my ideas to life and is someone easy to work with. 

- As a user, i want to be able to navigate through the website with minimal trouble and effort. I would like to know what page i am currently and what page i’m about to visit. I want to see a website that is aesthetically pleasing. 

- As a user i want to see the *HOME page* to set a tone for the website. 

- As a user i want the *ABOUT ME page* to tell me who the creator is as well as their journey. I also would like to see a image of the creator to help me get an understanding of who they are. 

As a user i want to see the *PORTFOLIO page* display the work of the creator along with a description and, be able visit it websites/applications via a link once the creator and created such work. 

As a potential client or collaborator i want to be able to contact the creator either by email which should be visible on the  *CONTACT ME page* or to contact the creator via a contact form.
