# Personal Portfolio
This is my first project through The Learning People's front end developers course.
## Description
This is my Personal Portfolio where i will display my course/personal/client projects for future clients, employers and anyone who wants to just view my work.

## UX
### Home
My *Home page* will be the first page the users sees so it is important I draw the user in with a logo that sets the visual tone for my websites. The logo I have used is a logo that was created for the purpose of the project with subtle colours to give the user the idea that my portfolio is pleasing on the eye but easy to navigate.

### About Me
My *About me page* is to give the user a brief description of who i am, what i look like and my front end development journey.

### Portfolio
My *Portfolio page* will be where the user comes to view my projects. There will be an image of the websites, a brief description and a link that will take them to each project in a new page.

### Contact Me
My *Contact me page* is designed so any potential clients/collaborators are able to get in touch but provide their name, email, subject matter and a short message. My contact details are also displayed should they wish to choose another method to get in touch. 

### User Story
- As a potential employer, i want to know more about the developers journey and i want to see different projects he has created or contributed to.  

- As a penitential company business looking for a freelancer, i want to know if the developer can bring my ideas to life and is someone easy to work with. 

- As a user, i want to be able to navigate through the website with minimal trouble and effort. I would like to know what page i am currently and what page i’m about to visit. I want to see a website that is aesthetically pleasing. 

- As a user i want to see the *HOME page* to set a tone for the website. 

- As a user i want the *ABOUT ME page* to tell me who the creator is as well as their journey. I also would like to see a image of the creator to help me get an understanding of who they are. 

- As a user i want to see the *PORTFOLIO page* display the work of the creator along with a description and, be able visit it websites/applications via a link once the creator and created such work. 

- As a potential client or collaborator i want to be able to contact the creator either by email which should be visible on the  *CONTACT ME page* or to contact the creator via a contact form. 
 
## Technology
- Balsmiq 
    - I have used Balsamiq to create my mockups to help me get a visual understanding of what i want my portfolio to look like across allpages. 

- Wireframe
    - My Mockups(wireframes) were done using Balsmiq for a simple look so i can focus more on the layout and design rather than the finer details such as colour, font and specific images. I have done a mockup for each screen size the responsive look for my website.  

Please see each links below.

- Visual Studio Code
    - I have used VS Code as my text editor to create my HTML, CSS and README files along with the terminal on VS Code to commit regular changes to my GitHub repository. 

- HTML5
    - I have used HTML5 to structure my content for my portfolio

- Bootstrap v5
    - I have used bootstrap for a responsive grid system. Bootstrap has helped structure my webpages with positioning before adding CSS3. 

- CSS3
    - I have used CSS3 to add custom styles to html tags, classes and id’s to bring the content on my portfolio to life. 

- Google Font
    - I have used google font which was downloaded to my macbook to give my portfolio a more modern stylish look. 

- Git
    - I have used Git version control system to consistently add and commit changes.  

- GitHub 
    - I have used GitHub to push and store all my committed changes to my portfolio via Git and i have used Github pages to deploy my website. 

## Testing

- Chrome DevTools
    - I used DevTools responsive testing, to help test positioning if elements, widths and heights of images and elements. I also constantly tested my website at different break points such as mobile, tablet and desktop to give me a better understanding of how my site would look on each screens and to make necessary changes that would help the users experience. 

**Each page was test and customised individually for most parts**. 

- HTML Validation
    - I used [W3C HTML Validation service](http://validator.w3.org) to test my HTML code. 

- CSS Validation 
    - I used [W£C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to test my CSS code
