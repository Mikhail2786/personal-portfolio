            Hi, my name is Mikhail Stewart from London, UK, I am currently studying to be a Front End Developer and hope to add to the skills Iâ€™m learning with the Learning People Ltd to one day become a Full Stack Developer. I have been studying Front End Development for the last Month after being made redundant and will be one of the BEST Web Engineers.
